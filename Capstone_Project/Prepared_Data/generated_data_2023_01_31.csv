la présente invention concerne des systèmes, des procédés et/ou des éléments chauffants utilisés lors du traitement de formations souterraines. certains systèmes et procédés ont généralement trait à des éléments chauffants et des systèmes de chauffage destinés à des formations souterraines. certains systèmes et procédés portent de manière générale sur de nouveaux composants utilisés avec ces éléments chauffants et ces systèmes de chauffage. certains systèmes et procédés se rapportent généralement à des barrières et des composants associés aux barrières employés au cours du traitement de formations souterraines. certains systèmes et procédés concernent de manière générale des puits de production et de nouveaux composants destinés à la production de fluides à partir de formations souterraines.","the claims defining the invention are as follows; 
1. i. a system for heating a hydrocarbon containing formation, comprising: a conduit located inan opening in the formation, the conduit comprising ferromagnetic material; 5 an electrical conductor positioned inside the conduit, and electrically coupled to the conduit at or near an end portion of the conduit so that the electrical conductor and the conduit are electrically coupled in series and electrical current flows inthe electrical conductor in a substantially opposite direction to electrical current flow in the conduit during application of electrical current to the system, wherein; 10 during application of electrical current to the system, the flow of electrons is substantially confined to the inside of the conduit by the electromagnetic field generated from electrical current flow in the electrical conductor so that the outside surface of the conduit is at or near substantially zero potential at 25*c; the conduit is configured to generate a majority of the heat output of the system to heat the formation during application of electrical current to the system and to allow a fluid to flow through the 15 conduit to recover heat from the system; and the opening has a first end portion at a first location on the surface ofthe formation and a second end portion at a second location on the surface ofthe formation. 
2. the system ofclaim 1,wherein the outside of the conduit is substantially electrically isolated from the formation.
3. the system ofclaim 1,wherein the conduit isptoximate the formation.
4. the system ofclaim 1,wherein the conduit is proximate the formation such that heat generated ina wall of the conduit transfers to the formation.
5. the system ofclaim 1,wherein the conduit has an outer circumference that is greater than an outer circumference ofthe electrical conductor, and heat generated in the conduit wall transfers from the outer 25 circumference ofthe conduit to the formation.
6. the system of claim 1,wherein the conduit has a wall thickness of at least one skin depth of the ferromagnetic material at 25 'c.
7. the system of claim 1,wherein the conduit is electrically isolated from at least one adjacent conduit located in the formation.
8. the system of claim 1,wherein a majority of the conduit is oriented substantially horizontally ina hydrocarbon layer ofthe formation.
9. the system of claim 1,wherein the electrical conductor is substantially electrically isolated from the conduit along a length of the conduit, and the electrical conductor is electrically coupled to the conduit near an end portion of the conduit. 35 10, the system of claim 1,wherein the system further comprises one or more centralizers to electrically separate the conduit from the electrical conductor. il. the system of claim 1,wherein the system further comprises a thin electrically insulating layer on a surface of the conduit and/or on the outside surface of the electrical conductor.
12. the system of claim 1,wherein the conduit is configured to provide a first heat output below the 40 curie temperature of the ferromagnetic member, the conduit being configured to automatically provide a second heat output approximately at and above the curie temperature of the ferromagnetic member, and the second heat output is reduced compared to the first heat output.
13. the system of claim 1,wherein the electrical conductor is an insulated conductor, the insulated conductor including an electrically conductive core inside an electrically conductive sheath with electrical 5 insulation between the core and the sheath.
14. the system of claim 13, wherein the core is copper and the sheath isnon-ferromagnetic stainless steel.
15. the system of claim 1,wherein the system has a turndown ratio of at least 2 to 1.
